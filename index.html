                Hello! I am Honglei Liu, a recent new graduate student from Stony Brook University,SUNY
                with a degree of Master of Science, majoring in Computer Engineering. I am proficient in
                Python and C/C++, and familiar with Java and JavaScript. In the meantime, I am learning 
                Back-End DevOps. Currently, I am actively seeking Software Engineer full-time position.
                Feel free to contact me anytime if you have interests on me.

                        Charging problem becomes more serious when commercial electrical vehicles are introduced.
                        In this research, I performed code revision for the existed simulation program
                        to make the extracted NYC taxi dataset fit the proactively partial charging algorithm.  
                        In addition, a visualized version of proactively partial charging algorithm is being developed.

                        LLVM/OpenMP is one of the top choice for parallelism compilers. 
                        In the research, I optimized the 
                        omp_target_memcpy() function by introducing new variables and extending various conditions. As a result,
                        when we do memcpy from one GPU to another GPU, as long as the GPUs come from the same vendor, a direct
                        memcpy will be performed instead of using CPU as media.

                        iOS is one of the most wide-using OS in mobile field. Thanks to XCode and Swift programming language, we can develop iOS applications
                        much easier. Following the tutorial, we designed a simple off-line multi-choice quiz application. Currently, there are only a few
                        algorithm analysis problems. However, we will add more flashcard-liked coding problems. In addition, we will setup servers to
                        provide up-to-date problems.

                        Self-Driving is undoubtedly a hot and interesting topic nowadays. With the help of EAGLE, we designed our
                        own PCB from scratch, realizing speed-change and turning on servo-motor. We also programmed a PID controller
                        in the OpenMV components so our car could dynamically changing its speed based on the road condition. Last but
                        not the least, we tuning our PID controller to reach the max speed of our car.
